### Objective

Implement a movie streaming dashboard using JavaScript and React.

### Brief

You are the owner of a movie theater in **Thikkiiana City,** on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. Your customers are bored with the never changing selection and are asking for something completely different - they want to see what's playing on Earth. Wookies are the main exporter of Computer Technology for the New Republic so naturally you roll up your sleeves and get to work. You quickly scribble down some notes and after a few hours of relentless work you have a design in mind.

### Tasks

-   Implement using:
    -   Language: **JavaScript**
    -   Framework: **React**
-   Build out the project to the designs inside the `/Designs` folder
-   Connect your application to the **CodeSubmit Movie Database** at `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies`
-   For authentication pass the `"Authorization: Bearer Wookie2021"` header
-   Parse the API response and display the results as outlined in the design. **Make sure to group movies by categories**.
-   Implement a detail view for the movies in the list
-   Make sure that inking to detail pages as well as bookmarking works as expected
-   Implement search by connecting to `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies?q=<search_term>`
